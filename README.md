# The hard limits of decoding mental states
This project contains the code necessary to reproduce the results and plots from "The hard limits of decoding mental states," by Jabakhanji et al. All analyses were independently completed in MATLAB and R. While the exact algorithmic approach may differ for each language, as different authors implemented the methods from scratch, our results converge.

## R code
The R code was written by Andrew Vigotsky (vigotsky@u.northwestern.edu) and contains everything necessary to reproduce both the raw results and figures.

## MATLAB code
The MATLAB code was written by Rami Jabakhanji (jabakhanji@northwestern.edu) and contains everything necessary to reproduce the raw results, but not figures.
